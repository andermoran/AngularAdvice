# Ander's Angular Adivce

## Basics

- Angular (currently on Angular 8) is a framework that allows for dynamic, reactive web applications as well as native mobile applications
- It is a combination of TypeScript (a subset of Javascript) and HTML
- The "main" file is `app.component.ts` which is a component itself which is loaded into the home html page, index.html

## Components
- Components are similar, one could even say analogous. to classes in OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Similar to objects, components are made to be reused in and it helps keep the LOC (lines of code) lower in the main file, `app.component.ts`

## Data Binding
 ### String Interpolation
- Allows you to communicate between your TypeScript code and HTML template in your component by using `[` and `]`
```html
<p>Hello, my name is  {{ name }}!</p>
```
- Where `name` is a variable in the corresponding TypeScript code
- The variable being interpolated into a string can be a `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc. as long as it can be represented as a `string` in the end
- [Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cau2tt)
> Notice the `name` variable in `app.component.ts` and the `{{ name }}` in `app.component.html` 

### Property Binding
- Bind HTML attributes to TypeScript variables using `[`  and `]`
```html
<button [disabled]="buttonDisabled">Click me</button>
```
- Where `buttonDisabled` is a variable in a component file
- If `buttonDisabled` is `true`, then the button is disabled, if it is `false`, then the button is enabled
- [Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-2knkts)
> Notice the `buttonDisabled` variable in `app.component.ts` and the `[disabled]="buttonDisabled"` in `app.component.html` . Try changing the value of `buttonDisabled` from `false` to `true`

### Event Binding
- Bind HTML DOM events such as `click()` to a TypeSript method using `(` and `)`
```html
<button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me</button>
```
- Where `onButtonClick()` is a method in a component file
- So whenever `click()` fires, it triggers `onButtonClick()`
- [Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-2knkts)
> Notice the `onButtonClick()` method in `app.component.ts` and the `(click)="onButtonClick()"` in `app.component.html` 
- Can pass data with event by using the reserved `$event` keyword
- `$event` can be passed to the component method through the parameter in the HTML template
 ```html
 <input type="text" class="form-control" (input)="inputUpdated($event)"/>
 ```
- In our TypeScript code, we can reference this via 
```typescript
inputUpdated(event: Event) {
	this.myVar = event.target.value;
}
```
> TypeScript might complain about this syntax because it does not explicitly know that the event has properties we are assuming it to have
![TypeScript complaining about variable's vagueness](https://github.com/andermoran/AngularAdvice/blob/master/images/event_error.png)
> To fix this, we can be more explicit and type
```typescript
inputUpdated(event: Event) {
	this.myVar = (<HTMLInputElement>event.target).value;
}
```
> Now TypeSript knows that we know that the type of the `HTMLElement` of the event is `HTMLInputElement`
![TypeScript no longer complaining with variable and is now happy](https://github.com/andermoran/AngularAdvice/blob/master/images/event_error_fixed_explicit.png)

> *Note from [Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps):*
>  How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to  `console.log()` the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers
> **Important**: For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click))
> The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for  `YOUR_ELEMENT properties` or  `YOUR_ELEMENT events` should yield nice results
